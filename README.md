In this project, I train a set of classical models to predict game properties. Then, use perfomance metrics to decide which of the models is best suited for predicting each selected prperties.

To run the notebook, use:

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "${PWD}":/home/jovyan/work quay.io/jupyter/datascience-notebook:2024-05-27
```
